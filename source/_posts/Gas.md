title: Gas

There is a gas building up inside of me.

I know this because my fingers are wider, thicker than they were yesterday. They aren’t puffy like I had too much sodium. More like a balloon thats begun to hold too much helium.

More than it was designed to.

I don’t know what it is made of or if it is lethal but it is growing. Continuing to form from inside of me.

If something isn’t done i think my skin will split. Right down my spine.

My ear drums are being forced away from my skull as if I’m flying, the plane has finally reached altitude, and they are just about to pop. But they can’t.

Like tiny champagne corks that wont let the pressure out.
