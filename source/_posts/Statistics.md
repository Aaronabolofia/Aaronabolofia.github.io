title: Statistics
---
You made the best breakfast sandwich before class the semester we had statistics together

We hiked to Andrews Hall in two feet of snow and freezing weather

It was wrapped in foil
I used it as a small hand warmer in my sweatshirt pocket

I donâ€™t remember if it was actually statistics
If it was Andrews Hall
Or even if there was that much snow on the ground

I remember the warmth walking with you

For such a small sandwich
Its memory takes up a lot of space
