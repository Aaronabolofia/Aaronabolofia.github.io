I sandwich my head between my pillow and mattress. My scalp like a single slice of bologna between two pieces of white bread. Mayonnaise sticking to it from both sides. Our new mattress is much larger than before and I’m not sure if you’re still here. In the past I would reach over to feel the heat from your thigh. Our new mattress is much larger than before. Stubbornly, I lift my head to open one eye. Im alone in this bed. It’s much larger than before. The baby cries. The dogs bark. The alarm buzzes.
