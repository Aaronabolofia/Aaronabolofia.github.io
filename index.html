  <p>Samuel wasn’t sure if he could handle another. He sat thinking about the one in front of him.</p>
<p>“Gail, think about the money we would save if we didn’t. I already know I’m going to wake up feeling like shit in the morning from the first.”</p>
<p>He was afraid he would be less like himself after another. Even more than he was now.</p>
<p>She told him to stop worrying.</p>
<p>“Just order the second pitcher Samuel. We’re having a good time!”</p>
<p>She took a sip of the beer in front of her.</p>

  <p>There is a gas building up inside of me.</p>
<p>I know this because my fingers are wider, thicker than they were yesterday. They aren’t puffy like I had too much sodium. More like a balloon thats begun to hold too much helium.</p>
<p>More than it was designed to.</p>
<p>I don’t know what it is made of or if it is lethal but it is growing. Continuing to form from inside of me.</p>
<p>If something isn’t done i think my skin will split. Right down my spine.</p>
<p>My ear drums are being forced away from my skull as if I’m flying, the plane has finally reached altitude, and they are just about to pop. But they can’t.</p>
<p>Like tiny champagne corks that wont let the pressure out.</p>
